# GNP_Rule_Mining

This is just a little side project. I'm trying to implement Genetic Network Programming based association rule mining, something I wrote a research paper on. More specifically, I'm trying to use this to generate a solution for the challenge presented [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection). A paper regarding medical image classifiers generated with gnp can be found [here](http://www.jatit.org/volumes/Vol36No2/5Vol36No2.pdf).
